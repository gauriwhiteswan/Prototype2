# Prototype2

MCP-based security prototype with PEP/PDP enforcement.

# Secure MCP Agent Integration

This project demonstrates a **secure, policy-governed integration** between AI agents and enterprise tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Capabilities
- Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
- Policy Decision Point (PDP)
- Tool contracts and least privilege
- Prompt injection protection
- Claude Desktop integration

## Why This Is Safe
- Agents never receive credentials
- Explicit allow/deny policies
- Auditable security decisions

## Designed to Scale
- Multiple agents
- Multiple MCP servers
- Centralized policy management
- No New Reruns
